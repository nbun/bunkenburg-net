title: Baking Bread with a 3D Printer
---

3D printers usually have a heated bed which ensures that prints stick to the surface and do not warp while printing.
Since the temperature of the heated bed can be controlled very precisely and my printer is enclosed, I had the idea
of using the heated bed for [proofing bread dough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofing_(baking_technique)).

32Â°C seems to be a good temperature for the yeast to do its job, so I configured the printer accordingly and patiently
waited.
After about an hour, the dough had risen significantly and was ready for the oven.

Looks pretty good, doesn't it?
