<p>Hi, my name is Niels. I recently finished my Master's degree in computer science at CAU Kiel and I am currenctly looking for interesting job opportunities.</p>

<p>I like functional programming and the formal proof assistant Coq, both of which have been part of my theses. You can check them out <a href="papers.html">here</a> if you are interested.</p>

<p>My work experience includes programming embedded applications in Delphi and designing back-end infrastructure using Go.
   I have a decent understanding of server administration and know my way around tools like git.</p>

<p>Besides programming, I enjoy tinkering with all sorts of electronics. Microprocessors? Great. Combined with motors? Even better. A 250Â°C hotend strapped to it? Awesome! <br>
   3D printing and CAD are my favorite activities when I feel like designing a useful or decorative object. Need anything 3D printed? I can probably help! </p>

<p>I like to take my camera with me while exploring the world. Feel free to have a look at some of my favorite photos <a href="photography.html">here</a>.<p>
